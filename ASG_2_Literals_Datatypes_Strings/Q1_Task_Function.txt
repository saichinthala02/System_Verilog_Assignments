Q. What is ment by task/function invocation?

A. Task or function invocation refers to the process of calling a task or function from another procedural block (such as an initial, always, or another task/function) in order to execute the statements in that task or function.

	Example: Addition of two Numbers using funcion.
	
		module top;
			int a,b,sum;
		//--> Function
			function int add(input integer a,b);
				return a+b;
			endfunction
		//--> Procedural Block
			initial begin
				sum=add(10,20);  //--> Function invocation.
				$display("The sum of 10 and 20 is %0d",sum);
			end
		endmodule
